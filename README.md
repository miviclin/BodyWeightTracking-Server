# Bodyweight Tracking API Server

## Overview

Sample API that allows tracking bodyweight over time. This is a pet project just to try out swagger so it does not use a real database and it has not been created to be used as a real production server.

This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project and uses the [swagger-tools](https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools) middleware.

```
npm install
```
